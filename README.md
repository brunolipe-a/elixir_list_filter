In this challenge, you must create a function that, given a list of strings that represent numbers or not (example `["1", "3", "6", "43", "banana", "6", "abc"]`), filter all numeric items in this list and return how many odd numbers are in this list.

For example, we have the following input e expected output for the function that receves the list:

```**bash**
iex> ListFilter.call(["1", "3", "6", "43", "banana", "6", "abc"])
...> 3
```
